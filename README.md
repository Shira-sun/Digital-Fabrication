# Digital-Fabrication

This week I continued to read about the consept of memory palace. When thinking about which images I want to incoporate, I felt like going into my own memory would be the best route. I wanted to cupture the collective memories that are ingrained in me- memories of my family, my ancestor, my city.

After a work meeting with Stuti, we decided to make this memory palace come to life by adding a sound AR expreince to it. The glass dome would be arrange in a structre (tbd). The visitor will have an ipad, and when viewing the minuatre, a sound of the place represented in the miniature will be played. We hope that this expreince could enhance the filling of capturing memory and plave via objects.
